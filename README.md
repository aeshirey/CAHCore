Cards Against Humanity in .NET Core

This is a very simple app that deals you some cards so you can play over Microsoft Teams, Discord, or your favorite realtime conferencing app.

Click a card once to select it. Click it again to copy the card's text to your clipboard and to remove it from your hand, drawing a new card. Then you have to paste it into your chat app, pal. Figure it out.

When you win a hand, you'll have to draw a prompt card separately from `File` -> `Deal Prompt Card`.

This is a v0.1.0-alpha, so... Good luck. Feel free to submit your awesome enhancements to this crappy program.
